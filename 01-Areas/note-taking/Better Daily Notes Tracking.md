# Better Daily Notes Tracking
I've written some thoughts and ideas and now in my daily notes and tracking. How can I reference these ideas without manually going back all the time to check them? How can I link them to goals or projects? 

I have several *learning* goals that I'm trying to accomplish

1. Javascript
2. Shell
3. Linux 
4. Lua 
5. Python 
6. Rust 

This is a lot when I write them out. 

We can't link directly to hastags without some complicated dataviewjs that I'm not interested in learning. 

Is it possible to link each daily note to a item that updates in action?
