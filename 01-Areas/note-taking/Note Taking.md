# Note Taking

[inspirational management system](https://github.com/EliWimmer/Obsmd-Life-Manager/blob/master/06%20Guide/Daily%20Note.md)
Here I'm going to assemble some ideas and findings about my note taking.

## Traditional Zettelkasten method

1. Fleeting notes: notes you take on the fly
2. Literature Notes: Condensed notes of an entire article, book, video, etc...
3. Permanent Notes: Summarzing an idea. These are assigned key-words and linked.

### Suggested Method from "Digital Zettelkasten"

Use 3 separate folders

1. Inbox
   1. use for input of fleeting notes that need to be "processed."
2. Someday/Maybe
   1. Idea from _Getting Things Done_ productivity system.
   2. When you come across something interesting but not interesting enough relevant to current projects.
3. Raw
   1. Storage of exported highlights from books and articles.

## Utilize the Map of Content

In a MOC, the party is always happening. It's the "room where it happens." MOC's are fluid while Table of Contents TOC are more rigid. Often times an MOC and change into a TOC.

Consider using a **home note** as the highest level in the zettelkasten / digital library. It can have links to all the major MOC's.

## Using aspects of PARA

- PARA
  - Project - "a series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline"
    - Programming Project
    - Blog Post
    - Hobby Project like Arduino
  - Area of Responsibility - "a spehere of activity with a standard to be maintained"
    - Health or Fitness
    - Personal Development
    - Hobbies
  - Resource - "A Topic or theme of ongoing interest"
    - Habit forming
    - Project management
    - coffee
    - note-taking
  - Archives - "Inactive items from the other three categories."
    - completed projects
    - Inactive interests

# Readwise workflow

Highlight notes current tags

1. books
2. articles
3. tweets
4. podcasts

# My Workflow (currently)

1. **Investigate**: Requires further _reading_ at another time. Usually added when a topic is came about that's relevant to the current topic but needs further study to grok the concepts. Change tag to _investigated_ when a reading note is completed.
   1. **Highlights and Annotations**: will be reviewed and followed.
2. **Reading**: While reading taking notes about the subject. Trying to be atomic as possible and linking concepts and ideas togther within new _reading_ notes.
   1. **Highlights and Annotations**: will be reviewed and followed.
3. **Permanent**: The _reading_ status has been removed and the notes organized and reviewed. They've been added manually to a MOC rather than using a dataview to act as a table of contents.
