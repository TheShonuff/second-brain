# Leadership
- Stop hitting the snooze button. 
	- Start the day right
- Natural trajectory is toward self.
	- Start every interaction with the other person in mind.
	- Lead with questions
- The leaders who get the most out of their people are the leaders who care most about their people.
	- Start in your heart. 
	- If you don't like your team
		- You have the wrong people
			- Who you have is:
				- What you have created and tolerated.

**Success is the weighted average of everyone**
