## Highlights
- Thinking / “The Man Who Thinks He Can” by Walter D. Wintle:
  > “If you think you are beaten, you are 
  > If you think you dare not, you don’t, 
  > If you like to win, but you think you can’t 
  > It is almost certain you won’t.
  > 
  > If you think you’ll lose, you’re lost 
  > For out of the world we find, 
  > Success begins with a fellow’s will 
  > It’s all in the state of mind.
  > 
  > If you think you are outclassed, you are 
  > You’ve got to think high to rise, 
  > You’ve got to be sure of yourself before 
  > You can ever win a prize.
  > 
  > Life’s battles don’t always go 
  > To the stronger or faster man, 
  > But soon or late the man who wins 
  > Is the man WHO THINKS HE CAN!” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnc8n6vezc10d50mb5vjhm5r))
