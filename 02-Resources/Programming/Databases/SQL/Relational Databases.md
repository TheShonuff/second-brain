# Relational Databases
- A relational database allows tables to be related by means of a common field.
- As few as two tables can be considered a relational database if they share a common field.
> [!note] Realistically, databases used have many tables, each table sharing common field with another table.


## Properties of Tables
There are six properties of tables in relational databases.
1. Entries in columns are single-valued
2. Entries in columns are of the same kind
3. Each row is unique
4. Sequence of columns is insignificant
5. Sequence of row is insignificant
6. Each column has a unique name
