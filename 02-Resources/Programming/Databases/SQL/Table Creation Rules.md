# Table Creation Rules
- When creating a new table, use the following rules:
	- Must begin with a letter

	- Must contain only A-Z, a-z, 0-9, \_, \$, and \#
	- Must not duplicate the name of another object owned by the same user
	- Must not be an Oracle Server reserved word

- If a table will store information about students, name it STUDENTS, not PEOPLE or CHILDREN
- Table names are not case sensitive
- Table name should be plural
- Creating tables is part of SQL's data definition language (DDL)
	- Other DLL statements include
		- ALTER
		- DROP
