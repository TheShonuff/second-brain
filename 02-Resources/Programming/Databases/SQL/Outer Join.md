# Outer Join
- When a join returns the unmatched rows as well as the matched rows
- Outer join uses the terms:
	- [[Left Join|Left]]
	- [[Full Join|Full]]
	- [[Right Join|Right]]
> [!tip] These names are associated with the order of the table names in the FROM clause of the SELECT statement.


[[Inner Join|Inner]] VS [[Outer Join|Outer]] JOINS
- An inner join finds and returns matching data from tables
- An outer join find and returns matching data and *some* dissimilar data from tables.
