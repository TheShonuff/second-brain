# SQL Statments
There are four main categories of SQL statements
1. Data manipulation language **DML**
	- Begin with *INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE* or *MERGE* and are used to modify the table data by entering new rows, changing existing rows, or removing existing rows.
1. Data definition language **DDL**
	- Create, change and remove data structures from the database
	- *CREATE, ALTER, DROP, RENAME* and *TRUNCATE* begin DDL statements.
1. Transaction control language **TCL**
	- Used to manage the changes made by DML statements.
	- Changes to the data executed using *COMMIT, ROLLBACK* and *SAVEPOINT*
	- Changes can be grouped together into logical transactions.
1. Data control language **DCL**
	- *GRANT* and *REVOKE* are used to give or remove access right to the database and the structures within it.
