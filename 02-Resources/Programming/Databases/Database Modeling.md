# Database Modeling

## One-To-Many
There are seven steps to designing a one-to-many database.
1. Understand the one-to-many relationship.
	- Each table represents an object i.e a person, car, product or business.
2. Write a sentence
	- "Store the customer information and the orders that they have made"
	- "Store the cars and the showroom that they are located in"
	- "Store the students and the courses they are enrolled in at a specific date"
3. Write down the objects from this sentence.
	-  "Store the *customer information* and the *orders* that they have made"
	- "Store the *cars* and the *showroom* that they are located in"
	- "Sotre the *students* and the *courses* they are enrolled in at a specific *date*"
4. Determine One-to-Many Relationship.
	- Ask yourself.. "Does *object1* have many *object2s*, or does *object2* have many *object1s*"
5. Create a Diagram
	- Using a tool like *lucid chart* plan the database
6. Draw a line in the diagram
7. Add to the Diagram to describe the one-to-many relationship.
		

## Many-to-Many
- Many records in one table relate to many records in another table.
- A joining table is used to help create a many-to-many database design.
