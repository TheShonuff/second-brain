# Relative Positioning
Moves and element outside the normal document flow. Top, Right, Bottom or Left would indicate the *extra* space added to the flow as the **relative** element is shifted into the new position. 

The following would add 250px to the top and 450px to the left.
```css
position: relative;
top: 250px;
left: 450px;
```

>[!note]
>layout of the other elements would be not be affected
