# Absolute Positioning
Places an element at a specific coordinate within a container which can be expressed in pixels or percentages.

The following example would set the header element 620px from the top edge and 30px from the left.

```css
header {
	position: absolute;
	top: 620px;
	left: 30px;
}
```

> [!note]
> Do not use all four positions. Only use 2; Top/Left or Bottom/Right or similiar
