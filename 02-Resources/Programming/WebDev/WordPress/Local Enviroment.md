# Local Enviroment
- Using the `npm -g install @wordpress/env`
- Can work from the a stand alone folder in the another directory
- Can work in the wordpress directory image itself.

>[!tip] Stop the `wp-env` in the same directory it was started.


>[!tip] You can start the exact wordpress instance you want in `.wp-env/` by using `wp-env start` within the directory. IF this instance was configured from a theme or plugin directory it will not load those files
