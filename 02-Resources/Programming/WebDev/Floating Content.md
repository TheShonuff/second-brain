# Floating Content
Created: [[11-02-2022]]
- **Floating** an element takes it out of position and places it along the left or right edge of its parent element.
```css
float: position;
```
- *none* is the default value
- *left* is towards left margin
- *right* is towards right margin
- When several elements are aligned on the same margin they're aligned in the same row.
