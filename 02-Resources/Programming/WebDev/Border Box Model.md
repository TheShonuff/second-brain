# Border Box Model
Created: [[11-02-2022]]
- width property is based on the sum of the content, padding, and border spaces and any space taken up by the padding and border subtracted from space given to the content
```css
box-sizing: border-box;
```
- Simply if set an elements width to 100px. That 100px will include any border or padding you added and the content box will shrink to absorb that extra width.
