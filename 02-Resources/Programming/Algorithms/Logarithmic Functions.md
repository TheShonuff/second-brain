# Logarithmic Functions

The inverse of an exponential function. 
${\Large log_ax}$ *is the inverse of* ${\large a^x}$ 

We can use $${\Large(log_xy=b) = (x^b=y)}$$ to find values. 

> [!note] ${\huge log_2}$ is typically used in CS

Where an exponential function grows more and more over time, a log function grows less and less over time.
