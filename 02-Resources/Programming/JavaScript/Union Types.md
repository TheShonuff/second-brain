# Union Types

Sometimes we want to have a couple of choices in what our function will accpet. We can use the union **|** operatoin the type definition to tell the compiles to accept both data types.

> [!note] Often working with multiple types a runtime check will need to be perfored using **typeof** to check for the expected type
