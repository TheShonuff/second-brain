# Array Type

We can have mixed data types in TypeScript. The keyword for mixed data types in arrays is **any**. Otherwise we would implicity set the data type.
```js
let favoriteActivites: string[];
favoriteActivtes = ['Sports', 'Reading']
```

This could also be written as 
```js
Array<number>
```
