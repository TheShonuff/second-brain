# Core Types
There are many [[TypeScript MoC#Types|types]] but there are some core types.

>[!note] core primitive types in TypeScript are all lowercase!!

1. number 
	- encompasess **all** number types ie. floats, signed and unsgined 
2. string 
	- encompasses **all** text values 
3. boolean 
	- only understands **true** or **false**

TypeScript can infer the type by the initalized value. If the variable is not immidiately initalized with a value it's a good idea to assign a type. Otherwise leave the type declaration off.
