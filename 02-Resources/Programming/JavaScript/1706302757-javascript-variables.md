# JavaScript Variables
There are a few different ways to declare a variable in JavaScript.

## Let
The `let` keyword signals that the variable can be reassigned a different value.
The `let` can declare a variable without assigning a value. In this case the variable will automatically be assigned an `undefined` value.

## Constant 
The `const` variable *cannot* be reassigned, it's constant.
- `const` variables need to be declared with a value.
- Assigning a `const` variable will result in a `TypeError`.



## Naming Conventions
- camel casing is the standard convention
- Variables cannot start with a number
- Variables  are case sensitive 
- Variables cannot be the same as keywords
