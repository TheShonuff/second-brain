# Any Type

The most flexible type in TypeScript where we can store any data type. This is essentially comparable to how vanilla JavaScript treats types. This type essentially nullifes any advantage that TypeScript offers and is not recommended to use. Only use as a fallback when you don't know the type of data your're handling.
