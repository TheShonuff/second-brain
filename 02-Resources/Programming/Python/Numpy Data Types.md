# Numpy Data Types
| Type          | Type Code | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| int8, uint8   | i1,u1     | Signed and unsigned 8-bit (1byte) integer types                                              |
| int16, uint16 | i2,u2     | Signed and unsigned 16-bit integer types                                                     |
| int32, uint32 | i4,u4     | Signed and unsigned 32-bit integer types                                                     |
| int64, uint64 | i8,u8     | Signed and unsigned  64-bit integer types                                                    |
| float16       | f2        | Half-precision floating point                                                                |
| float32       | f4 or f   | Standard single-precision floating pointl compatible with C float                            |
| float64       | f8 or d   | Standard double-precision floating point; compartible with C double and Pythong float object |
| float 128     | f16 or g  | Extended-precision floating point                                                            |
| complex64     | c8, 16    | Complex numbers represented by two 32,64 or 128 floats repsectively                          |
| complex128    |           |                                                                                              |
| bool          | ?         | Boolean type storing True or False                                                           |
| object        | 0         | Python object type; a value can be any Python object                                         |
| string_       | S         | Fixed-length ASCII string type (1 byte per character)                                        |
| unicode_      | U         | Fixed-length Unicode type( number of bytes platform specific); same specification semantic as string_                                                                                             |
