# Python Strings Splitting and Joining
- The string method `split()` splits a string into a list of tokens. Each **token** is substring that forms a part of a larger string. A **separator** is a character or sequence of characters that indicates where to split the string into tokens.
- The `join()` string method performs the inverse operation of `split()` by joining a list of strings together to create a single string.
