# Else
- A loop may include the an **else** clause that executes only if the loop terminates normally and doesn't use a [[Break & Continue|break]] statement.

```Python
while expression:
	# Body
else:
	# else body
# Statemeents after loop
```

```Python
for name in iterable:
	# body
else:
	# else body
```

The **loop else** construct executes if the loop completes normally.
