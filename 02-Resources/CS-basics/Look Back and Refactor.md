# Look Back and Refactor

## Refactoring Questions
- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the result differently?
- Can you understand it at a glance?
- Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
- Can you improve the performance of your solution?
	- Time complexity
	- Space complexity
- Can you think of other ways to refactor?
- How have other people solve this problem?


It's worth it to look back and rethink the code and determine if it's the best solution. Relection and offer better insight.
