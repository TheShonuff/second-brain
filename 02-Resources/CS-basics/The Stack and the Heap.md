# The Stack and the Heap
The stack and heap are parts of memory available to your code to use at runtime, but they're structured in different ways. 

## Stack 
A Stack data structure 

Stores values in the order given and removes the values in opposite order. **Last in, first out.**

Think of the call stack as a stack of papers. When the computer is called to task it will put the action on the top of the stack. If the function is completed the item is removed. If the call includes another action, it's put ontop of the stack until it's completed. The process repeats until the code is finished. 

## Heap
