# statement
A *statment* is a **imperative** command, a verb, that the programmers gives to the computer.
```python
print "Hello, World!"
```
Another simple statement is
```javascript
a = 2;
```

> [!note]
> A statement is not the same as a function, which are multiple lines of code that are able to call at once. Functions are **not** imperative tasks.
