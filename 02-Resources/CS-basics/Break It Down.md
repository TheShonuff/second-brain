# Break It Down
Explicitly write ou the steps you need to tak.

This forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it, and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstanding before you dive in and have to worry about details.

This can be down by writing comments within the function to outline what we want to accomplish.

**it's all about process**
