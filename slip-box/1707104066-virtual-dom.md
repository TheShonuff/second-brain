# virtual DOM
Think of manipulating the virtual DOM as editing a blueprint, as opposed to moving rooms in an actual house.

When a JSX element is render, every single virtual DOM object gets updated. Once updated, then React compares the virtual DOM with a virtual DOM snapshot. This process is called *diffing*.

Once React knows what DOM objects have changed, then React updates those objects, and only those objects, on the real DOM.
