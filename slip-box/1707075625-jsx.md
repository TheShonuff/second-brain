# jsx
JavaScript XML, is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows for HTML-like code within JavaScript files.

>[!note] If a JavaScript files contains JSX code, it will need to be compiled.

JSX elements are treated as JavaScript expressions.

## Attributes
JSX elements can have *attributes* just like HTML elements. It can also contain multiple attributes.

## Nested JSX
HTML elements can be nested within each other. If a JSX expression takes up more than one line, then you must wrap the multi-line JSX expression in `()`.
```js
const theExample = (
    <a href="https://www.example.com">
        <h1>
            click me!
        </h1>
    </a>
);
```

>[!warning] JSX expressions must have exactly one outermost element. Just wrap multiple HTML in a `<div>`

## Rendering JSX
```js
const container = document.getElementById('app')
const root = createRoot(container)
root.render(<h1>Hello World</h1>)
```
React relies on two things to render: what content to render and where to place the content.

The `createRoot()` from `react-dom/client` library creates a React root from the `container` and stores it in `root` which can be used to render JSX expressions.

The `render` method of `root` is used to render the JSX expression.

Variables that contain nest JSX expressions can be passed to `render()` method.

## The Virtual DOM
React root's `render()` method only updates DOM elements that have changed.
