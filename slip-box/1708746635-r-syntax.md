# R Syntax

`#` are used to start a comment

## Data Types
- Numeric - Any number without a decimal
- Character - Any grouping of characters
- Logical - A TRUE or FALSE
- Vectors - A list of related data
- NA - The absence of a value

## Variables
Variables are assigned using `<-`. You can use the `=` but not the convention in R.
```R
message_string <- "Hello There"
```

## Vectors
List-like structure that contains items of the same data type.
```r
spring_months <- c("Marhc", "April", "May", "June")
```

>[!note] You can check the type of elements in a vector by using `typeof(vector_name)`  

>[!note] You can check the length of a vector using `length(vector_name)`

- Elements are accessed using bracket notation `[]` and the index starts at **1** not *zero*

## Conditionals
Very similar to JavaScript syntax.

## Logical Operators
- The *AND* `&`
- The *OR* `|`
- The *NOT* `!`

## Calling Functions
Like any other language.

## Importing Packages
To install the package `install.packages('package-name')` 
To import the package `library(package-name)`
