## Shopify Wordpress integration

- We're now committed to using Shopify for any type of payment processing
- How do we integrate the two seamlessly?
  - Link to shopify from wordpress?
  - ~~Use ShopWP plugin?~~
    - ~~This has a subscription cost~~
    - ~~costs $199 year~~
    - ~~Not a shopify owned plugin~~
  - Create a custom block
  - Will need to understand the requirements from shopify?
  - Easy as linking to shopify cart?
- Customer will need a shopify account to process any orders
  - How frictionless is this?

- The process. 
	- Bailey is the middle man. 
	- strive checkout 

Easy access from clinic?
- QR Codes
- Direct links to Shopify or Wordpress site?

Bailey creates a portal for customer via strive each time. 

Scheduled emails based on checkout of strive product. 
- Inform clients via newsletter

Does our membership level have shop codes?
- ~~Wordpress plugin~~

How do we track it? 
- How are clients tracked?
	- Shopify will have the ability to collect a database of purchases.
- How are they only able to purchase a set amount within a time frame?
	- Limit quantities based on products per month?
	- Guests should not be able to checkout products.
