# An update - Final
It's been a hot minute since I made an update here. I've finally found the motivation and the time to start writing updates. It's been nearly eight months since I've posted about my software development progression. There's a lot to cover, so here we go!!

# Development
Since I taken my foot of the gas on "get good" at web development, I've taken a more leisure approach to software development. I've spent time experimenting with other languages and frameworks. Where in the past I solely focused on the front-end development trifecta; CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

## Rust
After hearing about all the people rave about Rust on twitter and Reddit I decided to give a go. 

It has a very steep learning curve. The compiler is both combative and helpful. I started doing easy problems on [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/users/TheShonuff) and working my way up as I began to grok more concepts. Right now I've made it to level 5 kyu where I've seemed to plateau a bit. I'll begin writing about my journey with Rust development now that I seem to be working mostly in this language.

## NeoVIM
I've made a full transition away from VS code and started using Neovim full time. Another very steep learning curve. Why do i punish myself like this?

I initially spent several weeks setting up my development environment while learning the keymaps, Neovim API and Lua. A lot of people suggest to start your Neovim journey very bare-bones and work your way up as you learn the application and find your "needs." I wanted a VS code like experience from the jump so I followed a few tutorials and copy-pasted a lot of code from several dot file repositories. 

This approach, while it worked, lead to a lot of spaghetti code and disorganization. My lsp.lua file was a hot-mess. I had all the features I wanted like code-completions, lsp, highlighting, and formatting.

After a few months living with my development setup. I completely nuked it and went with [Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim). It has a lot of desired features out of the box. With some modification and help with some tutorials I have a environment I'm happy with it. Most importantly it's also fairly organized.

## Oracle SQL
I've started a new class at the local community college learning SQL. I haven't spent much time learning or using databases in any of my simple applications. This class has been a great introduction into that subject. I wish I choose the MySQL class as opposed to the Oracle variant. MySQL seems to be more applicable to what I want to do. 

The differences appear to be minor, Oracle has some special functions and JOIN's that are not included in the free open-source version of MySQL. The environment I'm using is a web-based query builder. I've tried to get the Oracle Developer Cli working but I haven't been able to connect to class database successfully.

## HacktoberFest 2022
This is was a lot of fun and a great introduction to learning how to collaborate on projects. I learned how to use Git merge, pull, push and diff's. I had over five solid contributions to projects that awarded me my free t-shirt. 10/10 will do it again this year.

# New Gear
Lastly I've upgraded my development setup with some fancy new gear. The cheap Phantom mechanical keyboard has been upgraded to a fancy Q1 V2 Keychron keyboard. I've swapped out the default brown switches with some [Salmon Tactile](https://kineticlabs.com/switches/kinetic/salmons) from Kinetic Labs. There are still some light modifications that I would like perform to improve the sound profile. Overall I'm very happy with this upgrade.

I also upgraded the main monitor to a Dell S3221QS 32 Inch Curved 4k monitor. This was a huge upgrade from the 28" 1080 Sony monitor. This monitor is so massive it made me realize how poor my eye sight was. Now I have to use reading glasses.
